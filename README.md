Exec 15 (Prime Numbers) Gerador (yield) - get_primes(1, 10) or get_primes(100, 200)
To check if a number is prime, simply test its divisors up to its square root (sqrt(n)).
This is because if n = a * b, at least one of the factors is less than or equal to sqrt(n).
2. interactive program in which you type the range in the terminal and it returns the primes using this version with yield
